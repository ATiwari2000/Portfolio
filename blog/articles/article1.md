# My fist blog article

This is my first blog article on this website and it will explain how this blog website was created and how it works.

## How is a blog article structured?

A blog post is a markdown file with a header that contains the following information:

* **title:** Here my first blog article
* **date:** 2/11/2022
* **author:** Tom Schmelzer

At the fifth line starts the actual content of the blog post.

For example this blog post can be found in the folder `blog\articles\article1.md` of the GitHub repository which can be found [here](https://github.com/schmelto/Portfolio).

## How the website displays the blog posts

In the blog folder there are two files:

* blogposts.json: This file contains a list of all blog posts which should be displayed
* blog.html: This file is the main page of the blog. It contains a list of all blog posts.

The actual rendering of the md files and conversion to html is done in `js/blog.js`.
In here there is a markdown parser that converts the markdown files to html.

## How to add a new blog post?

* Create a new markdown file in the folder `blog\articles`.
* Add the following header to the top of the file:

```md
title: My first blog article <br>
date: 2/11/2022 <br>
author: Tom Schmelzer
```

* Than add the content of the blog post to the file. The content can be in multiple lines.
* Last but not least, add the blog post to the list of blog posts in the file `blogposts.json`.
